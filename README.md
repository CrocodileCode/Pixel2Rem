# Pixel2Rem
Converts pixel values to rem values.

The concept of a "px to rem" app would be to help web developers convert pixel values (px) to rem units. Rem units are a relative unit of measurement that is based on the font-size of the root element, typically the <html> tag.

The app could have a simple interface where the user inputs the pixel value they want to convert, and the app automatically converts it to the equivalent rem value. The app could also allow the user to specify the base font-size that they want to use for the conversion, as this can vary depending on the design requirements.

Some additional features that could be included in the app are:

A history of previous conversions, so the user can easily reference values they've already converted.
The ability to convert from rem to pixels, in case the user needs to go the other way.
A calculator function that allows the user to perform basic math operations with rem values.
Overall, a "px to rem" app would be a useful tool for web developers who want to use relative units of measurement for their website design, and need an easy way to convert between px and rem values.
